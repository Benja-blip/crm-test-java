# crm-test-java

This is a program written to test the same CRM that's tested in the CRM-Test repo written in Python.

This program, however, is obviously written in Java, and it is a much more thorough test (although still not complete).

At the moment, the program simply tests the CRUD operations for the database that manages companies.
