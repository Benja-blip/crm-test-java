# crm-test-java

This is a program written to test the same CRM that's tested in the CRM-Test repo written in Python.

This program, however, is obviously written in Java, and it is a much more thorough test (although still not complete).

At the moment, the program simply tests the CRUD operations for the database that manages companies.

The program shows the following output:

Connected to home page.
Connected to welcome page.
Connected to companies page.
Connected to create company page.
Company created.
Checking accuracy of company details.
Successfully verified accuracy of all entries.
Connected to edit page for Test Company.
Updating company information.
Successfully edited all fields.
Company deleted
